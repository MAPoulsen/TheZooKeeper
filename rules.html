level one-----
there are seven enclosures in your Zoo.
Each enclosure has a different environment.

Your zoo isnt completely finished, but you just found out that you will be recieving animals from a failed circus and animals from an illegal zoo in Idaho that was shut down by police this morning. 
The anmials are on thier way and some are at the gate already. You arent sure what animals are coming, so you will have to manage your enclosures and occupants the best you can. You have to find enclosures for the animals quickly though! 

You can put more than one species in an enclosure. But you cant put animals in the wrong environments or they will die.
You can't put natural predetors in with thier prey. 

When you select the animal at the entrance you will see an image and it will tell you the options for the animal. You will then click on the enclosure you want to leave the animal in.
if it is an acceptable environment and the preexhisting occupant poses a low threat to the new animal, you can leave it there. Earn 10 points.
if you try to leave it in an unacceptable environment, one that has its predetors in it, the wrong temperatures or humidity, or one that is too small/ has too many occupants in it already, Peda will boycot your zoo and you loose 50 points.
If you leave an animal in an enclosure where it can be killed by a predetor, you loose 40 points.
You do have a petting Zoo. If you have an attractive petting Zoo you earn 20 points every minute. In order for it to be attractive it must have a nice variety of non-aggressive animals.
You only have a limited time to find a home for each animal. If you exceed 20 seconds your animal dies and you loose 30 points.
You can use 100-200 points to create an additional enclosure. 100 is a small enclosure and 150 is a medium and 200 is a large. You can select the environemnt you need to create.
You can rearrange animals as you go. Simply click on the environment and the occupant, and select move animal from the promt, then click on the enclosure you wish to move it to. This will not effect your points, and it will not stop your clock.
